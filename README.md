# ric-weather-history

I started this project trying to replicate a graph I saw on Twitter last year, which showed how the expected first and late frost dates had both shifted by about 2 weeks over the last 80 years - making winter shorter.

The climate data comes from [NOAA's NCEI/NCDC GHCN-Daily](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/metadata/geoportal/rest/metadata/item/gov.noaa.ncdc:C00861/html)

I found [Get_NOAA_GHCN data](https://github.com/aaronpenne/get_noaa_ghcn_data) to be very helpful in converting the Daily format to tabular data.
